HIRE
=======================

**HIRE** is written in Python (Python>=3.6).

ED_y^tot = \sum_{r} + \sum_{r}

\sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i

    **Data cleaning**

    Removed minus values and filled missing values, removed one or two lines with more values (meausring errors?
    (some entries have huge minus values? Some have more than 48 measurements?)

    Only those datasets are used which cover full years!!

    THE VALUES ARE AGGREGATED ONLY ON A MONTHLY BASES AS TO FEW DATASETS COVER FULL YEARS



Energy Demand and Energy Supply Interaction
=======================
The linkages between the energy demand and energy supply 
modelled are shown below. All other model interlinkages 
are also visualised.

The energy demand and energy supply model can be run in an optimised and constrained version. The difference between the two modes is visualised below.

A word from our sponsors
========================

**HIRE** was written and developed at the `Environmental Change Institute,
University of Oxford <http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk>`_ within the
EPSRC sponsored MISTRAL programme, as part of the `Infrastructure Transition
Research Consortium <http://www.itrc.org.uk/>`_.
